Summary of the Project: HANGOVER ESCAPE
This is a text-based game where you move room-to-room, explorint. 
After a night you can't remember, find your way out of an unfamiliar place, but not before finding your belongings.


Description of the Project:
We use a yaml file to store the metadata for the game so that new games can be initialized with ease.
We implement the project in Python because it caters to object oriented design, which is the design of choice fot this text-based adventure game.
Rule of Seperation: The game mechanisms are partitioned into a game engine and user interface.
Rule of Simplicity: By employing object-oriented desgin, we break the game implementation down into smaller pieces represented by classes.
